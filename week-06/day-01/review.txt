CSS LAYOUT REVIEW

-BOX SIZING
box-sizing: content-box; VS box-sizing: border-box;
content-box = content size + padding + border. 
border-box = content size only. the padding and border are incorporated in the value of the content. 

-DISPLAY
block: div, p, all h's, blockquote. Stacked from top to bottom.
inline: a, code, etc. Stacked from left to right.
inline-block: Stacks from left to right if there's space and wraps when space shrinks. 
none: Hides the elements. 

-FLOAT
takes an element out of the natural flow of the doc.
